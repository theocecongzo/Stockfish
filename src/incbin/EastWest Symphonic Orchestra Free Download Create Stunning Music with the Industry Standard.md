## How to Compare EastWest Symphonic Orchestra Free with Other Versions
 
EastWest Symphonic Orchestra Free is a great way to get started with orchestral sampling, but it has some limitations compared to the other versions of EastWest Symphonic Orchestra. The main differences are:
 
- The sample set is limited to stage miking only, which means you cannot adjust the balance between close, stage and surround microphones[^1^]. This affects the depth and spatiality of the sound.
- The library does not include all the instruments and articulations available in the other versions[^2^]. For example, you will miss some solo instruments, harp, piano, choir and ethnic instruments.
- The library does not support 64-bit operating systems or Mac OS X 10.7 or higher[^3^]. This might cause compatibility issues with some DAWs or systems.
